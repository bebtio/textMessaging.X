# textMessaging.X

This is a summer project that I've been working for the past couple of weeks due to it being summer break following a semester
full of microcontroller stuff and me becoming super bored after one day of break.  After making some big edits to the 
project and then realizing that I completely screwed it up and that I also didn't have a way to restore 
previously working version, I FINALLY decided to get smart and start using some form of version control to document changes.  
I'll try to be as clear as possible on how this thing is supposed to work, considering that this is for the sake of my sanity
more than it is for yours.

The main focus of this project was to create a text messaging environment using the PIC24FJ64GA002 microcontroller from
MICROCHIP, the NOKIA 5110 lcd screen, and RFM12B-S2 Wireless Transceiver - 915MHz to send wireless text messages.

Here is a list of these parts and some purchasing information.
